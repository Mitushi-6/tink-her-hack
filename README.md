# [“Inkwell” – Where ideas come alive on every page.] 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: [Eagleeyes]

### Team Members
- Member 1: [Mithra P Suriakanth] - [Adi Shankara Institute of Engineering and Technology]
- Member 2: [Mitushi Manoj] - [Adi Shankara Institute of Engineering and Technology]

### Hosted Project Link
[https://mitushi-6.github.io/tink-her-hack/]

### Project Description
[Inkwell is an interactive digital journal that lets users capture their daily thoughts, ideas, and memories in a visually engaging way. Users can write, organize, and flip through their journal pages like a real book, while adding images, cropping them, and turning them into personalized stickers for a creative touch]

### The Problem statement
[Many people struggle to maintain a daily journal due to the lack of engaging and interactive tools. Traditional journaling can feel monotonous, and digital alternatives often lack personalization, creative expression, and the tactile feel of flipping through pages. Users also find it difficult to integrate multimedia elements like images seamlessly into their journals.]

### The Solution
[Inkwell solves these problems by providing a digital journaling platform that mimics the experience of a real flip-book. Users can write freely on beautifully designed pages, flip through their entries, and personalize their journal with images by cropping and placing them as stickers. This interactive approach encourages consistent journaling while allowing creative expression, making the process engaging and enjoyable]

*System Architecture
User – Opens the app, logs in, and interacts with the journal.

Login Page – Accepts username and password; after login, goes to the home page.

Home Page – Shows a folder representing the journal; clicking it opens the journal.

Journal Page (3D Book) – Contains a thick brown cover and multiple pages that can flip.

Editable Pages – Users can write directly on pages without accidentally flipping them.

Page Flipping – Clicking outside the writing area flips pages realistically.

Local Storage (Optional) – Saves written entries in the browser for later retrieval.

Data Flow:
User → Login → Home → Select Journal → Open Book → Write → Flip Pages → Save (optional)

Tech Stack:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (front-end only)*

## AI Tools Used (Optional - For Transparency Bonus)

If you used AI tools during development, document them here for transparency:

**Tool Used:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, v0.dev, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude]

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
- Example: "Generated boilerplate React components"
- Example: "Debugging assistance for async functions"
- Example: "Code review and optimization suggestions"

**Key Prompts Used:**
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately 90%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
